#### HEADER -------

## This code creates data set at the firm-year level with info on
# 1. emissions
# 2. BvD id
# 3. NACE codes
# 4. country codes
# 5. number of allowances allocated for free
# 6. number of total allowances allocated

# Obs:

# 1. firm_id and bvd_id are not 1:1 matching. There are more distinct firm_ids than
# there are bvd_ids. This is because there are some firm_ids which contain "0" in front and some that
# don't, even in cases when the underlying identifier is the same
# (e.g. firm_ids 0419052173 and 419052173 are matched with the same bvd_id)
# also, there are multiple firm_ids for which bvd_id is missing (and therefore belongs to the category
# of firms for which firm_ids are different but bvd_id is the same, in particular bvd_id == "")
